The original code used in PFIXCORE is normally placed under the GNU LESSER
GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (LGPL).  See the file LGPL.txt in the parent dir for
details.

BUT for the editorapplet contained in this directory and the subdirectories,
we used very much code from other projects which use the GPL as their license.

To comply with this license, all original code for the EDITORAPPLET is also 
released under the GPL.

(TODO: list the projects we use code from here and the license they use)
