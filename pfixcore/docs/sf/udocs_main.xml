  <h1>Configuration of a <pustefix/> project</h1>

  <p>Starting a new project in your <pustefix/> environment requires
     (besides developping the business logic and the UI) that you edit
     a bunch of configuration files.  Three different types of config
     files exist:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        The <a href="project.html">project definition</a> file. This file is
        used to list all the information that is needed to generate an
        apache config file and the servlet container's config files for
        this project. Also the project info needed for the editor
        application is given here.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a environment-wide portion
        of the configuration (located at
        <code>DOCROOT/servletconf/projects.xml.in</code>) that handles
        properties common to all projects. Additionally, there is, for each project,
        a file called <code>DOCROOT/MyProject/conf/project.xml.in</code> that contains the
        project specific information.
      </p>
      <p>
        The build system builds the final
        <code>DOCROOT/servletconf/projects.xml</code> file by merging
        the project specific and the environment-wide files. See <a
        href="project.html#list">here</a> for more information.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The second type of configuration file is a <a
          href="prop.html">property file</a> for (almost) all servlets
        that you have defined for your project in the associated
        <code>project.xml</code> file.  Again, there is also a common
        property file used for all servlets
        (<code>DOCROOT/common/conf/pustefix.prop.in</code>). See <a
        href="prop.html#list">here</a> for a list of used java
        property files.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The third type is a XML file that defines the <a href="depend.html">UI and page structure</a>
        of the project.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
