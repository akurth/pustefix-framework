  <h1>The servlets used in <pustefix/></h1>

  <p>
    The processing of a request in <pustefix/> starts with a servlet
    that is derived from <code>de.schlund.pfixxml.ServletManager</code>.
    This class implements session creation, redirecting into sessions,
    handling of SSL and other services for it's descendants.
  </p>
  <p>
    The main feature of it's session handling is that it's mostly
    transparent to the user. You can submit data to a URL, and the
    system will take care to store the supplied data (this is done in
    the form of a <code>PfixServletRequest</code>, which can be seen
    as basically the same as a <code>HttpServletRequest</code>, with
    some additional features, e.g. more or less transparent handling
    of file uploads), create a session, redirect to the URL with an
    embedded session id, and continue with the business logic and the
    data submitted with the original request afterwards.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even SSL is handled transparently. A descending servlet must
    implement the method <code>+ needsSession(): boolean</code> to
    decide if the the current request should result into the session
    to be "secure". You don't have to make sure that the webpages use
    "https://" in all needed links, the target itself tells the system
    that it want's to run under SSL.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the servlet decides that from it want's to run under SSL from
    now on, a complex redirect sequence happens that makes sure that
    all data is copied from the previous insecure session into a new,
    secure session (a session is secure if it's session id was never
    transmitted over an insecure channel). After a session has once
    transformed into a secure one, there's no way back: Every time you
    try to use the session with "http://" it will create a new, secure
    session dropping the old one (because it's tainted now).  If the
    visitor's browser supports cookies, the system manages to map
    request with the old, original, insecure session id (which can
    happen whenever the user uses the back button of her browser to go
    back to a page that has still the old session id embedded in every
    link) to the new, currently running secure session and silenty and
    securely redirects to this session.

    The commonly used servlets
  </stdimg>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>de.schlund.pfixxml.DerefServer</code>
      <p>
        This is a small servlet that should be used whenever a link to
        a URL outside the own site is made. All such foreign links
        must be of the form
        <code>/xml/deref?link=http://some.other.domain/foo/bar</code>
        This is important because for any link that goes directly to a
        foreign destination (e.g. &lt;a
        href="http://some.other.domain/foo/bar"&gt;) makes the session
        id visible in the logfile of the foreign site's webserver (via
        the <code>Referer</code> header). This is of course a security
        problem. Using the <code>DerefServer</code> avoids this by
        using a redirect loop so the Referer header transmitted will
        no longer contain the session id.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>de.schlund.pfixxml.AbstractXMLServer</code>
      <p>This servlet, while still abstract, implements most of the
      output handling needed for servlets that want use XSLT/XML to
      produce the final html sent to the browser.</p>
      <p>The only thing a descendant needs to implement is the
      abstract method <code>+ getDom(PfixServletRequest) :
      SPDocument</code>, whose return value can be thought of as a
      small container around a <code>org.w3c.Document</code>. The
      additional data stored in a SPDocument is among other things a
      map of XSLT transformation parameters that should be set and the
      "page name" which the system uses to choose the correct target
      stylesheet to transform the DOM with.
