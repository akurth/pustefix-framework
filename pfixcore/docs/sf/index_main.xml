  <h1>What is Pustefix</h1>

  <p>
    <pustefix/> is a framework that helps you to develop web based
    applications (referred to as <i>projects</i> here). A high level
    view of the system is given on <a href="overview.html">this</a>
    page. The framework consists of two more or less independent
    parts:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>A machinery to apply recursive XSLT transformations that
      produces the UI of the web application. You can learn more about
      this <a href="xml.html">here</a>.</li>
    <li>A Java framework that takes input from the UI to change the
      application data and supplies changes of the application data back
      to the UI. This part is explained in much more detail <a href="java.html">here</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Together, the framework acts similar to the <i>Model-View-Controller</i> pattern.

  <h1>Development news</h1>

  <p>There has been no release for a long time, sorry about that. I
    try to do that more often, but if there is no recent release, the
    best you can do is using the CVS tree and create the needed files yourself (just type <code>ant notag</code>).
    We try hard to have the CVS tree compilable at all times, although we can't make any guarantees, of course.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The transition to ant is complete. You need to have at least ant 1.5.4.</li>
    <li>because of the long time without a stable release, there are numerous changes to many to list them here.
      I tried to report on any bigger change to the mailing list, plese look there (there are not that many postings). For a
      better overview, please look into the ChangeLog file.</li>
  </ul>
