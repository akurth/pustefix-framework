  <h1>What is Pustefix</h1>

  <p>
    <pustefix/> is a framework that helps you to develop web based
    applications (referred to as <i>projects</i> here). A high level
    view of the system is given on <a href="overview.html">this</a>
    page. The framework consists of two more or less independent
    parts:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>A machinery to apply recursive XSLT transformations that
      produces the UI of the web application. You can learn more about
      this <a href="xml.html">here</a>.</li>
    <li>A Java framework that takes input from the UI to change the
      application data and supplies changes of the application data back
      to the UI. This part is explained in much more detail <a href="java.html">here</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Together, the framework acts similar to the <i>Model-View-Controller</i> pattern.

  <h1>Development news</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Finally the apploader should work as advertised. After some trial and error we finally
      settled on using an external C-library to create the new objects in the VM without any initialisation.
      We hope that this solved most of the remaining issues. Also some
      <a href="apploader.html">documentation has been written.</a> 
    </li>
    <li>Some other small fixes. Refer to the ChangeLog for more detailed news.</li>
  </ul>
