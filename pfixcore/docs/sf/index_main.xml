  <h1>What is Pustefix</h1>

  <p>
    <pustefix/> is a framework that helps you to develop web based
    applications (referred to as <i>projects</i> here). A high level
    view of the system is given on <a href="overview.html">this</a>
    page. The framework consists of two more or less independent
    parts:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>A machinery to apply recursive XSLT transformations that
      produces the UI of the web application. You can learn more about
      this <a href="xml.html">here</a>.</li>
    <li>A Java framework that takes input from the UI to change the
      application data and supplies changes of the application data back
      to the UI. This part is explained in much more detail <a href="java.html">here</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Together, the framework acts similar to the <i>Model-View-Controller</i> pattern.

  <h1>Development news</h1>

  <p><b>The <code>State</code> interface has changed to incorporate a new
    method <code>boolean needsData(Context,
      PfixServletRequest)</code></b>. This change makes it necessary to port
    your own States to the new system. If you only have States that
    inherit from <code>StateImpl</code>, your code may still compile
    (because StateImpl has a default implementation), but you
    have to check your <code>getDocument()</code> method if it is
    still "correct". Please refer to the mailing list and/or the
    ChangeLog for in-depth information on how the semantic of States
    has changed.
