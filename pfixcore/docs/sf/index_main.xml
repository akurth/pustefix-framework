  <h1>What is Pustefix</h1>

  <p>
    <pustefix/> is a framework that helps you to develop web based
    applications (referred to as <i>projects</i> here). A high level
    view of the system is given on <a href="overview.html">this</a>
    page. The framework consists of two more or less independent
    parts:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>A machinery to apply recursive XSLT transformations that
      produces the UI of the web application. You can learn more about
      this <a href="xml.html">here</a>.</li>
    <li>A Java framework that takes input from the UI to change the
      application data and supplies changes of the application data back
      to the UI. This part is explained in much more detail <a href="java.html">here</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Together, the framework acts similar to the <i>Model-View-Controller</i> pattern.

  <h2>Sourceforge</h2>
  <pustefix/> uses <a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=72089">CVS</a>,
  <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pustefix-devel">mailing list</a>,
  web space and other services supplied by SourceForge. You can go to the

  <h1>Development news</h1>

  <p>
    We added more possibilities for the pageflow handling (See the ChangeLog for more information).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You can now set a pageflow even if the current page is no
      member of that pageflow. This allows to enter into any
      pageflow after the submit to the current page returns
      successfully.
    </li>
    <li>
      The request parameters <code>__jumptopage</code> and
      <code>__jumptopageflow</code> are similar to the common
      <code>__page</code> and <code>__pageflow</code> parameters,
      but they specify a page (and the associated pageflow) the
      system should jump to unconditionally after a successful
      submit. In other words: If there is a
      <code>__jumptopage</code> set, the system won't start the
      usual pageflow process, but instead jump to the specified page
      (selecting, if it exists, the value of <code>__jumptopageflow</code> as the
      new pageflow)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We upgraded our embedded tomcat to version 4.1.30
