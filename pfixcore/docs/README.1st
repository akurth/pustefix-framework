Hello and welcome to Pustefix...

To get you started quickly without reading through much documentation
(which doesn't exist anyway...), refer to the file ../example/INSTALL to get a
running sample application with Tomcat. 

Sometime in the future we hope to have a user manual that tells you
what you can do with pustefix and how to develop your own pustefix
applications. For now it's unfortunately RTSL, not RTFM :-(
