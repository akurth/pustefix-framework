  <title>Module Support</title>
    <para>
      Pustefix supports two ways for providing resources (include parts, images,
      stylesheets, etc.) used by different projects.

      <title>Resources within library JARs</title>
      <para>
        The first (preferred) way is to place a JAR archive somewhere in the library
        path (usually lib/) that contains a special deployment descriptor.
        This deployment descriptor has to be named META-INF/pustefix-module.xml in
        order to be recognized by the Pustefix build system. This deployment descriptor
        is a XML file with the following format:

      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<module-descriptor

  <!--
    The module name is used to construct the path the resources will be extracted to.
    In this example the path would be projects/modules/mytest/.
  -->  
  <module-name>mytest</module-name>
  <resources>
    <!--
      The srcpath attributes the directory within the JAR archive that contains the
      resources. The targetpath attribute is optional and specifies the path the
      resources are copied to (relative to the module directory). An empty targetpath
      (the default) specifies the module directory itself
      (e.g. projects/modules/mymodule) as the target directory.
    -->
    <resource-mapping srcpath="resources/txt" targetpath="txt"/>
    <resource-mapping srcpath="resources/images" targetpath="img"/>
  </resources>

      <title>Resources placed in modules/ directory</title>
      <para>
        The old way is to place a JAR file in the modules/ directory of the Pustefix
        environment. In this case no deplyoment descriptor is needed (and even if
        present it is not read). However you have to ensure that all files within
        the JAR file are in a properly named directory as the archive will be directly
        extracted to the projects/modules/ directory.

      <title>Actions applied on module resources after unpacking</title>
      <para>
        In Pustefix version before 0.10.0 the .xsl.in to .xsl transformation is applied on
        files placed in the projects/modules/ directory. In Pustefix versions since 0.10.0
        this transformations are not applied anymore, however after unpacking the resources
        a build.xml placed in projects/modules/&lt;module-name&gt;/ is run and can perform
        such actions.
