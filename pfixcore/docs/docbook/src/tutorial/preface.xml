  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>
    These tutorials are meant as a starting point for developers that have never worked with Pustefix.
    They introduce you to the different types of applications that can be implemented with Pustefix.
    Of course, they can only scratch at the surface of most of the features, if you are interested in 
    an in-depth look at Pustefix, refer to the reference documentation. 
  </para>
  <para>
    The source code used in the tutorials is available for public checkout. To test the tutorials on
    you local development machine, execute the following commands:
  </para>
  <screen>$ svn co https://pustefix.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pustefix/trunk/pfixtutorial
$ cd pfixtutorial
$ ant
$ ./startTomcat.sh</screen>
  <para>
    Of course, you can also start with a skeleton application and implement the tutorials from
    scratch.
