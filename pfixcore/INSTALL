This file describes how to get the package up and running.

Prerequisites:

        * A unixoid OS.  Yes, java should be platform independent.
          Unfortunately portions of the build environment and code
          are unix specific. Although these platform independant
          portions mainly deal with file system path secifications -
          they exist. There may be even more places where the thing
          wouldn't work on win32.

        * A Java installation.  Version 1.4.1 is recommended. 
          The environment variable JAVA_HOME must be set to the 
          root directory of your java installation.
          
        * Apache Ant, the Java-based build tool in version 1.5.4 or higher.
          If you have really large projects consider increasing the memory
          for the java vm ant runs in: To do this set the ANT_OPTS
          environment variable to something like "-mx200m". This variable
          is evaluated within the ant start script contained in the ant
          distribution.

        * jikes if you want to compile out-of-the-box.  Compilation
          with javac is of course possible, just set the build.compiler
          property to modern if you want to compile with the javac of
          your java installation. But belive me, you really want to use
          jikes, it's just lightning fast compared to javac.

        * A working apache installation with a working mod_jk
          (the apache connection module for tomcat). You need
          to have this module loaded, but you need no further
          configuration, the build process will take care of providing
          you with a sample config file that should at least get you
          started. Additionally the apache installation must provide mod_rewrite 
          (This should be pretty standard nowadays).

          Note that there have been problems with the order of
          inclusion of mod_rewrite and mod_jk in the
          httpd.conf. It seems that mod_jk needs to be loaded
          BEFORE mod_rewrite. If you experience problems, try changing
          the order of these two modules.  Other problems that have
          been experienced are related to a changed regexp syntax
          between different versions of mod_rewrite. You may have to
          customize the relevant regexps in the file core/build/create_apacheconf.xsl.
        
        * Your apache needs to have enabled name-based virtual servers
          for the default hostname of your machine. Furthermore you
          should have a "* entry" for your machine in DNS (This means that 
          a lookup to NAME.HOSTNAME.DOMAIN should resolve to HOSTNAME.DOMAIN no
          matter what NAME is). If you don't have DNS configured like this you can 
          still supply the names 
                 "cmsskel.HOSTNAME.DOMAIN" and "admskel.HOSTNAME.DOMAIN" 
          via your /etc/hosts file.

          Note that you may be able to work around this last point by tweaking the
          created apache.conf or by tweaking the producing stylesheet
          core/build/create_apacheconf.xsl; this is not recommended, though.

        * NOTE: you don't need a external installation of tomcat,
          everything you need is contained in this package.  I suggest
          that even if you have your own tomcat setup already,
          start by using the supplied versions, and, if all goes
          well, you can try to move the configuration into your own
          installation.

        * NOTE2: you don't need any additional jar files or classes besides
          what is supplied with your java installation and this package.
 
1)  Type "ant" to generate all neccesary files and compile all classes.

2)  You may want to type "ant generate" for pre-processing all the templates
    up-front. This speeds up the first hit of a page in the sample
    applications as the page doesn't need to be build from scratch then.

3)  Put something  like the following

        NameVirtualHost HOSTNAME.DOMAIN:80
        # uncomment if you want to use SSL
        # NameVirtualHost HOSTNAME.DOMAIN:443

        # config for mod_jk
        include <your path to this directory>/projects/servletconf/tomcat/jk.conf

        # virtual hosts for tomcat:
        include <your path to this directory>/projects/servletconf/tomcat/apache.conf

    into your httpd.conf. Don't forget to restart apache.

4)  start Tomcat with the following command:

        ./startTomcat.sh 

    Note: For stopping Tomcat, just press Control-C to interrupt the script.

    Note: There have been problems with restarting or
    stopping/starting tomcat. Somtimes a restart of Apache is needed,
    too, so mod_jk can catch up and reopen the connections to
    Tomcat. (FIXME: Is this still the case? I have not experienced
    these problems for quite some time now)
    
5)  To see if everything works, you can try to open the editor
    application. Point your browser to
        
        http://cmsskel.HOSTNAME.DOMAIN 

    Have Fun.


FINAL NOTE:

You could now start building your own applications, but unfortunately
there is still no documentation about how to achieve this. In the
future it is planned to provide an application that will help with
creating new projects, a sample application that serves as a tutorial
and the needed documentation to understand the whole system.
I hope this will happen soon :-/

For now, I suggest you refer to the mailing list (see pustefix.sf.net).

Just one warning for people trying to use the editor app as an example
for their own application: The editor works, but is quite old and in a
lot of ways can't be considered anymore a good example on how to
program a pustefix application. Of course we should rewrite the editor
to better conform to the pustefix programming model, but this will take
time.
