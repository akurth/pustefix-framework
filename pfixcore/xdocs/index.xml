  <p>
    Pustefix is a framework that helps you to develop web based
    applications (referred to as <i>projects</i> here). A high level
    view of the system is given on <a href="overview.html">this</a>
    page. The framework consists of two more or less independent
    parts:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>A machinery to apply recursive XSLT transformations that
      produces the UI of the web application. You can learn more about
      this <a href="xml.html">here</a>.</li>
    <li>A Java framework that takes input from the UI to change the
      application data and supplies changes of the application data back
      to the UI. This part is explained in much more detail <a href="java.html">here</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Together, the framework acts similar to the <i>Model-View-Controller</i> pattern.

  <p><b>Current release: 0.6.6</b></p>

  <p>
    We replaced the tomcat 4.1.x series with tomcat 5.0.x. Also, we
    now ship the complete tomcat package as it is released on
    jakarta. It resides in ./lib/tomcat/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.27.tar.gz
    and is unpacked during the build process. This makes it much
    easier to update to a new tomcat version because not all of the
    expanded tomcat package is in CVS. 
  </p>

  <p>Currently we ship the tomcat package together with the skeleton
  package. Probably we will stop doing this with the next version and
  have the user download a matching tomcat version themselves.
