  <section name="The Images pages">

  <p>
    In the left frame all images used in the current project are
    listed. If you select one of them detailed information will be displayed in the
    right frame. Additionally you have the possibility to upload
    a new image from your local computer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that it is only possible to upload an image that is already
    known to the system. To make an image known to the system you must
    reference it in an <a href="../xml.html#include_parts">Include part</a>.
    Images that are known but don't already have
    a file uploaded are marked with a blue "<b>!</b>" in the left frame
    display.

              <b>Box No. 1</b> contains backup options and the file
              upload user interface. Backup options appear whenever you change
              the image by uploading a new image file.  The timestamp
              of the former upload is then displayed in the select box
              and you can go back to this point of time by choosing
              the select box entry.  The file upload box allows you to
              select an image on your local filesystem and send it to
              the Pustefix editor server.
