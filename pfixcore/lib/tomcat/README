Put a binary package of tomcat here, straight from the jakarta site (http://jakarta.apache.org).
Please use a package that's packed as a gzipped tar file (.tar.gz).
Pfixcore is currently tested to run with

	apache-tomcat-5.5.17.tar.gz

Other versions of the 5.5.x branch should work, too. Your mileage may vary.
The build process will take care to unpack and configure this tomcat package, 
but you have to call "ant realclean" in order to remove any old tomcat that has 
been already unpacked and configured before.
