  <p>
    Pustefix is a framework that helps you to develop web based
    applications (referred to as <i>projects</i> here). A high level
    view of the system is given on <a href="overview.html">this</a>
    page. The framework consists of two more or less independent
    parts:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>A machinery to apply recursive XSLT transformations that
      produces the UI of the web application. You can learn more about
      this <a href="xml.html">here</a>.</li>
    <li>A Java framework that takes input from the UI to change the
      application data and supplies changes of the application data back
      to the UI. This part is explained in much more detail <a href="java.html">here</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Together, the framework acts similar to the <i>Model-View-Controller</i> pattern.

  <p><b>Current release: 0.8.1</b></p>
  <p>0.8.1 is a brown-paper-bag-release fixing a security hole in the DerefServer</p>
  <p>The big feature of this release is a lightweight webservices
  implementation for Pustefix and a JavaScript enabled Browser. The
  Java side of things uses AXIS, which is integated into Pustefix so
  that a webservice automatically has access to the ContextResources
  of the current session. The client uses our own small SOAP
  implementation in JavaScript and (depending on the browser's
  featureset) different transports to submit the data to server</p>

  <p>You can see changes with increasing details:</p>
