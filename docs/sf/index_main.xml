  <h2>What is Pustefix</h2>
  <pustefix/> is a framework that helps you to develop web based applications. A high level view of the system is given on
  <a href="overview.html">this</a> page. The framework consists of two more or less independend parts:

  <ul>
    <li>A machinery to apply recusrsive XSLT transformations that
      produces the UI of the web application. You can learn more about
      this <a href="xml.html">here</a>.</li>

    <li>A Java framework that takes input from the UI to change the
      application data and supplies changes of the application data back
      to the UI. This part is explained in much more detail <a href="java.html">here</a></li>
  </ul>

  Together, the framework acts similar to the <i>Model-View-Container</i> pattern.
