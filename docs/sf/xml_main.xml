    The XML/XSLT System of <pustefix/> is responsible for generating the
    final stylesheet that represent the static content of a page.  This
    stylesheets is then used together with the DOM tree that holds the
    result of the request as given by the business logic to produce the
    final HTML output.

  <p>The figure below shows the typical transformations and files that
    are involved in producing the final stylesheet
    <code>BazPage.xsl</code>. Note that we only discuss the common case
    here, arbitrary complex and deep transformation trees are in fact possible.
