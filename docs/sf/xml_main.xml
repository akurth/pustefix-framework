    The XML/XSLT System of <pustefix/> is responsible for generating the
    final stylesheet that represents the static content of a page.  This
    stylesheet is then used together with the DOM tree that holds the
    result of the request (as given by the business logic) to produce the
    final HTML output.
  </p>

  <p>The figure below shows the typical transformations and files that
    are involved in producing the final stylesheet
    <code>BazPage.xsl</code> (this is slightly simplified,
    <code>master.xsl</code> and <code>metatags.xsl</code> are in fact
    the product of yet another transformation, but the only thing these transformations
    do is to customize the resulting stylesheets to your particulary environment
    so they can be written without using e.g. absolute pathnames).</p>
  <p>
    Note that we only discuss the common case here, arbitrary complex
    and deep transformation trees are in fact possible.
