              This page is for editing user specific data like name, section, phone
              and password. Additionally you can define the rights a user has to edit
              different parts of your project(s). This is explained below.

            <td><b>Common rights</b>: These rights are shared among all existing projects.
              There are two common rights. The first determines if the user has admin role.
              Admins are allowed to edit anything and can manage all user data. The second
              determines if the user is allowed to edit the default branch of dynamic
              includes like statuscodes. The default branch of dynamic includes is used
              by all projects which do not have a product specific branch of them.

              <b>Project specific rights</b>: As the name says a project specific right 
              is only valid for a single project. It consists of a set of three
              special rights. Every project has such a set of rights.<br/>
              The first determines if a user is allowed to create and edit 
              include parts for the project. With this right you are also
              allowed to create and delete product specific branches.
              If you want to modify an include 
              which is used by another project you must have the '<i>Edit Includes</i>'
              right for this project.<br/>
              
              The next one determines if a user is allowed to upload images
              for the project. If you want to change an image which is used
              by another product you must have the '<i>Edit Images</i>' right for this
              product.<br/>

              The last right determines if you are allowed to create or edit product
              specific branches of dynamic includes.
