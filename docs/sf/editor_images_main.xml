          image and lists information on the current image.</p>
          <p>Box No. 1 contains backup options and the upload.
          Backup options appear if you have uploaded this image
          before. The timepoint of the former upload is then 
          listed and you can go back to this timepoint by selecting it.
          The upload allows to select an image on your local filesystem
          and to send it to the PustefixEditor server.</p>
          <p>Box No. 2 gives you information on all pages which
          use the current image. When selecting a page, it will
          be shown in the <a href="editor_pages.html">Pages</a> page.</p>
