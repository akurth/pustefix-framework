  <h1>The Pustefix Editor</h1>
  <p>The PustefixEditor is a project browser and editor shipped with <pustefix/>.
    It allows you to browse the structure of targets, pages and
    include parts of the projects in your <pustefix/>
    environment. Additionally you can create images and include parts
    and edit them.</p>
  
  <p style="margin:5px; border:1px solid red;"><b>Note:</b> The source code of the editor is not a good example
    for writing applications with <pustefix/>. This is due to the fact
    that this part of the code is quite old. For an example that should always be up to date with respect to the current
    features of <pustefix/> see the <i>sample1</i> application in the CVS checkout.</p>
  
  <h2>Getting started</h2>
  
  <p>
    Most people will start the editor directly from the page where they want to start editing.
    Another way is to start the editor application directly (by entering <code>cmscore.HOSTNAME.DOMAINNAME</code> in the
    case of the CVS checkout or <code>cmsskel.HOSTNAME.DOMAINNAME</code> in the case of the skeleton environment). In that case
    you would start (after a successful login) with the <a href="editor_prodsel.html">project selection</a> page.</p>
  <p>But for now let's assume  you want to change an include on the first page of the  <i>sample1</i> application.</p>
  <table>
    <tr valign="top">
      <td>
        <stdimg src="img/sample_editconsole1.png">
          The first page of the <i>sample1</i> application
        </stdimg>
      </td>
      <td>
        <table class="stdtable" style="min-width: 200px; margin: 10px; margin-left: 0px; width: 100%">
          <tr>
            <td>
              <p>
                In the red box you see the <i>edit console</i> divided
                into three different sections. Press the button with the
                pen symbol in <b>section 1</b>.  This button also shows the
                tooltip <i>Switch edit mode ON</i> when you move the
                mouse pointer over it. Now, the application will change
                into <i>edit mode</i> and look like the next image.
                The button itself changes into a pen with a red
                cross. Pressing it again switches the edit mode off.
              </p>
              <p>
                Note: The edit mode button only works if you set
                the <code>editmode</code> property (decribed <a href="prop.html#editmode">here</a>) to
                <code>true</code>.  Instead of switching to edit mode by
                using the edit console, you can alternatively start by
                appending <code>__editmode=admin</code> or switch off by
                appending <code>__editmode=0</code> to the URL.
              </p>

          <tr>
            <td>
              <b>Section 2</b> can be used to show the last DOM response tree from the business logic that
                was used to render the current page. Note that this DOM tree is only stored for some time
                in the system which is usually much shorter than the time the session is valid. (The skeleton
                environment defines this timout to be 10 minutes for test mode, and 20 seconds for production mode - but
                the whole feature is not available in production mode anyway, so the 20 seconds should be no problem)
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <b>Section 3</b> is only visible if you have declared a
              <code>record_dir</code> <a href="depend.html#record_dir">here</a>. Also have a look
              at the <a href="testclient.html">test client</a> documentation for more information about it.
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
      <td>
        <stdimg src="img/sample_editconsole2.png">
          The same page after the change into <i>edit mode</i>. Note the red brackets surrounding the include parts.
        </stdimg>
      </td>
      <td>
        <table class="stdtable" style="min-width: 200px; margin: 10px; margin-left: 0px; width: 100%">
          <tr>
            <td>
              Now the application is in <i>edit mode.</i>
              In edit mode every include part is framed by red curly brackets. Remember that include parts
              can be nested. After each closing curly bracket there is a small box with a
              pen symbol. Moving with the mouse over it shows the tool tip
              "<i>Edit include: 'PART' in file 'INCLUDEFILE'</i>". Pressing the box
              opens the pustefix editor in a new window starting with the <a href="editor_login.html">login</a> page.
              After successful login the include is automatically opened in 
              the <a href="editor_includes.html">Includes</a> page and can be edited in the editor applet.
