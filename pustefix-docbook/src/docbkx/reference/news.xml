    <title>What's new in Pustefix 0.22.0</title>
    <para>
      Added support for Spring 5. The minimum requirement now is Spring version 4.3.
    </para>
    <para>
      Pustefix states used as Spring MVC controllers with <literal>RequestMappings</literal> now work either with the deprecated
      Spring <literal>WebArgumentResolvers</literal>, or with <literal>HandlerMethodArgumentResolvers</literal>. Using Spring 4.3
      both are supported by Pustefix, since Spring 5 <literal>HandlerMethodArgumentResolvers</literal> are required
      (see <xref linkend="springmvc.annotationmethodhandleradapter"/> and <xref linkend="springmvc.requestmappinghandleradapter"/>).
