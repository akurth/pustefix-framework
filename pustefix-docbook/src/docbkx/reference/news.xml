    <title>What's new in Pustefix 0.21.0</title>
    <para>
      Pustefix now uses SLF4J as logging framework. It still supports the, meanwhile deprecated, first version of Log4j, but
      you're recommended to switch over to Logback or Log4j 2 instead. For both frameworks Pustefix provides some useful extensions
      (see <xref linkend="configuration.logging"/> and <xref linkend="upgrade.0_20_to_0_21"/> for details).
