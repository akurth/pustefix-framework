    <para>Pustefix 0.19.0 focuses on upgrading the underlying technologies/libraries. It added support for Servlet API 3 and Spring 4.
          The legacy dependency to Apache ORO was removed, i.e. stuff like regular expressions and LRU caches now are implemented completely
          based on the JDK standard library.

          in 0.19 too and the development of the 0.18 line will be discontinued. It's recommended to upgrade existing applications to 0.19 soon
          (see <xref linkend="upgrade.0_18_to_0_19"/>).
