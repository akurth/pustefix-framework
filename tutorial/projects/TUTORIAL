What goes here?
--@author SPP

The projects/ dir contains the xml/xsl parts of all projects within the pfixtutorial. 
To keep it simple there is only one project here. There are some directories that
contain files that are needed by all projects, you can simply copy the 
bin/, common/, core/ and servletconf/ directories from another project. You can find the complete
core/ directory in the file pfixcore-data-0.2.2.tar.gz

bin/					some scripts
common/		stuff that is used by multiple or all projects
core/				the pustefix core stylesheets
servletconf/		servlet configuration files

The ptutorial/ dir is the directory for the sample project of the tutorial. For further
information see the tutorial file there.

The Makefile in this directory can be copied, you do not have to adapt it!

The servletconf/projects.xml has to be adapted to your project. Simply substitute all occurrences of 
"pfixtutorial" with the name of your project  

Do not forget to link the generated apache.conf into your apaches conf.d/ directory 
otherwise it will not be accessible.
