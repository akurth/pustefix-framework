The PFixTutorial Project
--------------------------------

This project is supposed to be a tutorial for programming applications with the Pustefix Framework.
So far I made two TUTORIAL files that document what the structure of a project should look like 
and where everything is.

The file INSTALL contains some information what is needed besides this package to get 
an application up and running. 

What to do first:
--------------------

You should copy

- startJServ.sh, startTomcat.sh
- lib/ -> copy all needed jars here, pfixcore-0.2.2.jar
- bin/ -> contains a couple of scripts, simply copy
- Makefile (has to be adapted to your project)
- hopefully soon: build.xml (ant buildfile)

There are two places where you have to do stuff yourself

- src/ -> Java classes needed for the functionality of your app, these should be in the
	package de.schlund.yourprojectname.... empty dir now
- projects/ -> contains the xml/xsl stuff you will write and a lot of stuff you have to copy. 
	Simply see the TUTORIAL in that directory.
- res/ -> for error messages: currently empty


-Changes to httpd.conf:
----------------------------------------------------------
#Load mod_jk
LoadModule jk_module modules/mod_jk.so
# Use name-based virtual hosting.
NameVirtualHost <hostname>.schlund.de:80
NameVirtualHost <hostname>.schlund.de:443
----------------------------------------------------------
-link the generated apache.conf/jk.conf under tomcat dir into your apaches conf.d dir.
or else "Include ..../apache.conf" in the httpd.conf. 

mod_jk logging:
-----------------------
Another problem: mod_jk logs some stuff to a dir /var/log/.../httpd/ (as configured in jk.conf)
if you are running debian for example your apache is run as apache not as httpd so the dirs
are not called httpd and you should add the logging dir vor mod_jk by hand.
