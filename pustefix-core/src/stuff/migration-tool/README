The configuration migration tool helps you during the migration of a 
pre Pustefix 0.9.0 environment to a current version of Pustefix.

You can build the migration tool by running "ant" within the migration 
tool directory.

After you have built the tool, change to the root path ouf the 
Pustefix environment you want to migrate and run the shell-script 
do_migration.sh included in the "dist" directory of the migration tool.
