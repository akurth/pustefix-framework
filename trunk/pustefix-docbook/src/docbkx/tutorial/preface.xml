  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>
    These tutorials are meant as a starting point for developers that have never worked with Pustefix.
    They introduce you to the different types of applications that can be implemented with Pustefix.
    Of course, they can only scratch at the surface of most of the features, if you are interested in 
    an in-depth look at Pustefix, refer to the reference documentation. 
  </para>
  <para>
    You can either work through the tutorial by following the instructions and create the applications 
    from scratch (the preferred way for first-time Pustefix users) or you can just check out the complete
    source code (see  <xref linkend="gettingstarted.getsources"/>).
